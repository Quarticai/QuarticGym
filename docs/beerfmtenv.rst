BeerFMTEnv
===========

Beer is one of the oldest and most widely consumed alcoholic drinks in the world, and we have a lot of ways to produce them. This class provides a typical (and naive) simulation of the industry-level beer fermentation process. The only input that the simulation takes is the reaction temperature. The end goal in this simulation is to reach the stop condition (finish production) with a certain time limit, the quicker the better.

To better assist any control algorithms on this simulation, we also provided a . Please consult the 'profile_industrial' in the BeerFMT section `here <https://github.com/Quarticai/QuarticGym/blob/main/examples.ipynb>`_ for more details.
